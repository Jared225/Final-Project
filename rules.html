        <ul>
            <li>Draw:
                <ul>
                    <li>To draw a card you press the draw card button located at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>This version of Black Jack allows you to draw as many as 8 times until you are either satisfied with your score or your score is over 21</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Keep Score:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep Score allows you to keep your score that you curently have and will display a text box alert on what your final score is.</li>
                    <li>Use this button if you do not feel you can make a score of 21.</li>
                    <li>Example: you draw a Queen of clubs and a King of hearts and the only card that will give you 21 is an ace. Thus you choose to keep you current score without taking a risk by pressing the "Keep Score" button.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reset:

                    <li>The Reset button allows you to reset the score and the deck.</li>
